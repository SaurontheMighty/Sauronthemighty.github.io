Intropspekt is a journaling and happiness app built with the Flutter framework and the Dart language. The app was a complete project with the frontend in Flutter and the backend which was a Firestore database and some cloud functions.        ",description:"A cross-platform Journaling App",body2:"Introspekt is an app where you can record how your day was and interesting thoughts about each day. The Charts tab shows you how your week, month or year was in a graph. It also tracks your goals and the frequency with which you want to work on them. I used Firebase Firestore as the database and implemented security rules and cloud functions to secure it. I also implemented AES encryption to encrypt the text before it left the user's device to ensure that even database admins couldn't see any user data.\nThere were several very interesting aspects to this project: the technical, the marketing and the strategy. When I started this project, I had never made an app and never used Flutter, over the course of building it I got pretty comfortable with the framework and with Dart. The most interesting part was probably the database. \n\nI wrote an algorithm to push user data to the cloud and pull data from it. I had to think about all the use cases, like if someone had some data already on device which was newer than the data in the cloud, the data from the cloud should not erase it and so on. I also had to account for what  would happen if it failed midway because the internet blinked or someother reason and also incorporate options to delete all the user's data from the database for example if they no longer wanted to use the app. No matter how great a project, it's of little use unless people use it and so I set about marketing  this project. My main avenue of marketing was Reddit, I posted about it on a few subreddits where I got a lot of positive feedback and a lot of people seemed interested in it. Now, the app has over 50 users which is pretty exciting for me. Overall this was a really interesting project and building a production app is a really great learning experience.",slideshow:[{image:"ipage1.png",caption:"Calendar Page",key:1},{image:"ipage2.png",caption:"Goals Page",key:2},{image:"ipage3.png",caption:"Charts Page",key:3},{image:"ipage4.png",caption:"Settings Page",key:4}],author:"Ashish Selvaraj",links:[{link:"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=introspekt.app",caption:"Get it on the Play Store!"}],tags:["Flutter","Dart","Firebase","FireStore","Cloud Functions","AdMob","Sync-Across-Devices"],id:1},{title:"Productivity Extension",uid:"ductivitypro",thumbnail:"images/dpext3.png",body1:"With the pandemic, most of us are home and I thought this would be the perfect time to build a productivity extension.

I initially built this with plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript because I liked the simplicity and enjoyed seeing how fast the website loaded. However, recently I rewrote the JavaScript to use React, and it\u2019s probably one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. It allows me to just add posts as a JSON object and write the JSX syntax for a single post. React can then generate the rest on the fly with the power of JavaScript. ",body2:"This is also amazing because in the future it\u2019ll be really simple to set up a REST API and use fetch to get posts from an external database. It\u2019s also a really clean solution and I can avoid ridiculous amounts of DOM manipulation.\n\nReact Implementation: I set up a Post component and each post is generated as one of those, I then used the useState hook to show/hide posts as needed and also implemented the image carousel with useState. \nCSS: I was initially using Flexbox but I learned how to use CSS Grid and it made things really really simple. The way grid template areas let me layout designs is simply \u2728 magical \u2728. \n\nRewriting all the DOM manipulation seemed like it would be a drag but I actually really enjoyed playing with React.
