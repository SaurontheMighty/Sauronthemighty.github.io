It also has a goal/habit tracking option where you can set how frequently you perform the task and assigns a streak based on how many days you\u2019ve been able to keep it up.

The back-end is a No-SQL database in FireStore. Google\u2019s fuchsia OS is starting to make an appearance in products so I believe there\u2019s a future for Flutter yet. Since this was my first app, most of the logic and computation happens in the front-end on-device.\n\n    The backend comes into play as part of an optional sync-across-devices feature which allows the user to sync their data and journal entries across all of their devices. This was easily the most interesting part of the app. I was paranoid about security so despite the HTTPS connection between the device and Firestore, I also implemented symmetric AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption on-device. This meant that the data was encrypted with AES on-device and only then sent to the cloud. When the second device retrieved it from the cloud this information was decrypted. This also meant that I couldn\u2019t read any of the data which was a comfort because I didn\u2019t want to breach anyone\u2019s privacy. Another interesting feature I implemented was a \u2018Delete Account\u2019 feature. This may seem trivial and you may think that all it would take was deleting the user from Firebase Auth and Firestore but it proved tricky because the process occasionally failed midway. This was dangerous because if you just retried it, it would fail because part of the account would have been deleted so it wouldn't be able to find the account. So I wrote some code to store where it failed so instead of displaying an annoying \u2018Something went wrong\u2019 or \u2018Try Again Later\u2019 message, I could atleast tell them what percentage of the process had been completed and start from there next time. \n\n Overall, it was the most interesting project I\u2019ve worked on to-date and it really broadened my horizons with respect to apps, encryption and building a production worthy application.",slideshow:[{image:"ipage1.png",caption:"Calendar Page",key:1},{image:"ipage2.png",caption:"Goals Page",key:2},{image:"ipage3.png",caption:"Charts Page",key:3},{image:"ipage4.png",caption:"Settings Page",key:4}],author:"Ashish Selvaraj",links:[{link:"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=introspekt.app",caption:"Get it on the Play Store!"}],tags:["App","Flutter","Dart","Firebase","FireStore","Cloud Functions","AdMob","Sync-Across-Devices"],id:1},{title:"Productivity Extension",uid:"ductivitypro",thumbnail:"images/dpext3.png",body1:"A productivity extension that helps you stay on-track in a world of increasingly good recommendation algorithms.
