Hi, I'm Ashish!
I have experience building websites and apps! 

Website Built with:
- React Library
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

A personal blog and website with more details about the projects on my GitHub.

Projects I've written about:
- Introspekt
- H to O
- ductivityPRO
- Fireball
- SimpleEMS
- Android Timer
- UIKit iOS App
- Inventory Management System
- Bobrun

I built a landing page for a new project: [introspekt.app](https://www.introspekt.app/)

I'm designing and building a fully native journaling app called Introspekt. It'll be very different from the app by the same name I created in 2020.

This time it'll be built with SwiftUI and I'll do lots of product research and design.
