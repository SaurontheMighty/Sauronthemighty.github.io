      <article id='htoo' class="hidden">
        <span class="more" markdown=1>So far I've attended 2 online hackathons organized by MLH and I've built Flutter projects for both!<br><p id='more'>The first project is called H to O and the main idea behind this was to create an app that would allow you to create a shopping list of the items you need and then show you the store that was closest to you and had the items you wanted. I used the Google Maps API to create the map and add the markers which showed each location. When you tap the description it takes you to a Google Maps page with the directions to the store. I also pulled data from our Firestore database and updated the maps accordingly. Any change in the inventory of the store can be quickly reflected in the map. This was a really fun project for me because I got to learn how to use the Google Maps API which I hadn't used before.</p><br><div class='align'><img class="appimg" width="30%" src='images/flutter2.jpg'></div><br><p id="more">The other project is called FoodConnect and it's designed to connect donors to the Foodbanks. The idea was that a donor could add the items they have and the app would connect them to a Foodbank that needed those items.</p></span>

    <section class = "post productivity ductivitypro javascript html css browser extension">
      <h4 onclick="showMore('ductivitypro')">ductivityPro</h4>
      <p>A browser extension for Chrome and Firefox.</p>

      <article id='ductivitypro' class="hidden">
        <span class="more"><p id='more'>With the pandemic, most of us are home and I thought this would be the perfect time to build a productivity extension. With recommendation algorithms getting better and better its often really easy to spend far more time on website than you wanted to, this is what inspired me to build ductivityPRO(pro-ductivity).</p>
          <p id='more'>Once you install the extension, you'll notice its icon in the toolbar. Clicking this opens up its popup where you can set the amount of time that you want to be on that page. Once this time is over, the extension notifies you and tilts the page preventing you from spending any more time on it. The amount of tilt and the width of the border is fully customizable (both can be set to zero) and can be set from the preferences menu. This can be accessed by clicking the settings icon on the top right hand corner of the popup. Once a timer is set, you can click on the toolbar icon to check how much time is left.<br></p>

          <p id='more'>Another feature is "disable polymer" which can be enabled from the options menu. With YouTube's (relatively) new polymer design, you can't go back into full screen mode once the alarm rings. Once you enable this feature, the extension reverts YouTube to it's old design whenever it detects that you're watching a video. But if you're using this to curb your binge watching addiction you may want to leave YouTube as is.</p>
          <p id='more'>In order to put it on addons.mozilla.org, I had to choose a license. This was a really good learning experience because I learned about all the open source licenses and the pros and cons of each one. This is the important but less exciting part of building projects.</p>
          <p id='more'>I built a version for Google Chrome as well as Firefox. It was a really interesting process to learn how each platform differed. The current source code on Github has all the features and will work for both platforms.</p>
